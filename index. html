Kobe in high school
In 1996, Kobe attended Raul Merian high school in Raul Merian, a suburb of Philadelphia. Kobe was coached by his father when he was a sophomore in high school. Although his first year was mediocre, in the next three years, Kobe played all five positions and led the team to a record of 77-13. At Adidas ABCD camp, Kobe won the 1995 high school MVP award and played alongside his later teammate Lamar Odom. In high school, John Lucas, then head coach of the 76ers, invited Kobe to try out and train with the team, where he played one-on-one with Jerry Stackhouse. In his senior year, Kobe led the team to the first state championship in 50 years. In senior high school, Kobe averaged 30.8 points, 12 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 4.0 steals and 3.8 blocks. He led Raul Merrion high school to 31-3. At the end of his high school career, Kobe beat Wilt Chamberlain and Leon Simmons to break the high school scoring record in southeast Pennsylvania with 2883 points. With his performance in senior high school, Kobe has won several awards, including Naismith's best high school player of the year, Gatorade's best high school player of the year, McDonald's best team, and the first team player of the United States. Kobe's high school basketball coach Greg downer described him as "a dominant all-around player.". In 1996, Kobe invited R &amp; B singer brandy Norwood to his prom, even though they were just friends. Kobe scored 1080 on the SAT when he graduated, which was enough to ensure that he got a basketball scholarship and entered a good university. However, in the end, 17-year-old Kobe decided to enter the NBA directly, becoming the sixth player in NBA history to enter the NBA draft directly from high school. Because it's not common to enter the NBA directly from high school (Kevin Garnett is the only exception in 20 years), Kobe's decision has received a lot of attention.</p>
